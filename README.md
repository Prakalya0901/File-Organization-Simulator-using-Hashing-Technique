🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates a simple file organization system that stores and retrieves file metadata efficiently using a hashing technique.
It demonstrates how modern digital systems manage files internally for faster access and better data organization — aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9, which promotes innovation and digital infrastructure.

🎯 Objectives

To design and implement an efficient data organization method using hashing.

To simulate how file systems store and retrieve metadata (Name, Type, Size, Path).

To demonstrate how digital infrastructure can be made faster and more reliable.

To apply data structure concepts for real-world system design.

⚙️ Features

Insert new file metadata

Search for a file using its name

Delete existing records

Display all stored files

Uses chaining to handle hash collisions

Menu-driven and user-friendly console interface

🧩 Data Structure Used

Hash Table → for efficient indexing and access

Linked List → for collision handling (chaining)

💻 How to Run

Clone or download the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-organization-simulator.git
cd file-organization-simulator


Compile the program:

gcc file_organization_simulator.c -o file_organization


Run the executable:

./file_organization

📂 Sample Metadata Fields
Field	Description
Name	File name (e.g., project.c)
Type	File type (e.g., .c, .txt, .csv)
Size	File size in KB
